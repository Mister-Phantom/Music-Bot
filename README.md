### Great, now how do I use it?
Download the bot, set the dependencies up, then run `runbot.bat`! (or `run.sh` on mac/linux)  Read the tutorial if you don't know what to do.

If you have any errors, read the FAQ. If that didn't help, you can ask for assistance on the discord help server. Is is recommended to take screenshots so the developers can see errors.
